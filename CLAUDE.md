## Important Notes

### Git Workflow
- **NEVER push directly to the master branch**
- Always create a feature branch for your changes
- Push to the feature branch and create a Pull Request
- **ALWAYS check CI checks after pushing code**
  - Go to the PR page on GitHub
  - Verify all workflow checks are passing (green checkmarks)
  - If checks fail, review the error logs and fix issues before requesting review
- Wait for CI checks to pass before merging
- All changes must go through the PR review process
